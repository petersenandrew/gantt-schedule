## Background
The goal of this site is to create a useful scheduling tool while gaining practice in UI/UX design.

## Technologies Used
- **Jekyll/Github Pages**: A static site generator that transforms plain text into static websites.
  - Github Pages is a fork of Jekyll which enables me to create multiple pages with consistent headers without needing to edit each one individually. It also supports permalinks, allowing for clean URLs like `mysite.com/resume`.
- **Bootstrap**: A responsive front-end framework for developing visually appealing and mobile-friendly websites.
  - Bootstrap gives me a solid set of UI elements and supports mobile design right out of the box. This makes it easier and faster for me to build my site. This framework helps streamline the process so I don't spend hours stuck debugging.

## Installation
- Bootstrap Version: `5.3.3`
- Github Pages: `232`
```
